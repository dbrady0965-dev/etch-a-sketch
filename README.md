# etch-a-sketch
// <p>This project will compile all of the information I have learned over the last few weeks to create a browser version of a sketchbook/etch-a-sketch.</p>
<p>My basic understanding of JavaScript is leagues ahead of where it was when I started, and even though the syntax has been giving me some troubles. I think I will manage with this project.</p>
 <p>The webpage will contain grid squartes 16x16, hover effects so grids change colors when hovered over (making a drawing as one goes over it). Buttons and possibly some extras.</P>
